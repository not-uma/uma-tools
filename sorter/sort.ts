/**
 * our goal is to minimize the number of comparisons presented to the user required to fully sort the array. the
 * algorithm below derives from the observation that it's not really any more costly for a human to rank 3 items than to
 * pick one of two (or at least even if it takes longer it requires fewer comparisons and the hypothesis is that this is
 * a favourable tradeoff).
 *
 * we represent ordering progress so far as a graph where there is an edge between nodes u and v if the user ranked u
 * ahead of v. the order of a vertex in the final ranking is the longest path from the root node to that vertex. we
 * hypothesize that the selection algorithm below ensures that cycles will never be formed in the graph (NB. see below),
 * which means that the final ordering can be done in linear time.
 *
 * at each step we compute the transitive closure of the graph. the lower bound of a vertex in the final ranking is its
 * number of incoming edges in the transitive closure, and the upper bound is |V| - the number of its outgoing edges.
 * the vertices selected to be ordered by the user in the next step are those with the widest bounds that are not
 * reachable from each other. (this is done greedily, i.e. select the vertex v₁ with the widest bounds, then the next
 * vertex with the widest bounds not reachable from v₁ and that can't reach v₁, etc. i think this is not guaranteed to
 * find the optimal set and possibly not even guaranteed to be a good approximation of the optimal set.)
 *
 * this relies on two unproven assumptions:
 *   - this eventually terminates
 *   - this method of picking candidates makes cycles impossible no matter how the user sorts the candidates
 *
 * the tests in test/sort.ts are there to verify this is hopefully true.
 *
 * this approach is inspired by this stackoverflow answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/867740 but the selection heuristic
 * they propose of most common maximum path length does not actually work very well in practice (it usually results in
 * many more comparisons than the heuristic used here for example, sometimes twice as many in the worst case)
